/**
 * Rule is an abstract class for describing rules. It is abstract
 * because it is supposed to be extended by different classes
 * modelling different kinds of rules.
 * It provides the reset abstract method for randomizing the individual.
 * It also provides the mutate function for mutating an individual rule
 * It also provides the clone function for cloning the rule.
 *
 * <p>You will need to implement some kind of artificial ordering between
 * rules in a ruleset (the lt and gt methods inherited from SortComparator)
 * so the ruleset can be sorted in such a way that it can be compared with
 * another ruleset for equality.  You should also implement hashCode
 * and equals
 * in such a way that they aren't based on pointer information, but on actual
 * internal features.
 *
 * <p>Every rule points to a RuleConstraints which handles information that
 * Rule shares with all the other Rules in a RuleSet.
