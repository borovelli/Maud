/**
 * ESSelection is a special SelectionMethod designed to be used with
 * evolutionary strategies (ESEvolutionState) and its associated breeders.
 * The rule is simple: if your pipeline returns <i>N</i> children when
 * you called it, ESSelection objects must have been called exactly
 * <i>N</i> times (selecting <i>N</i> children altogether in that pass).
 * No more, no less.  You can use other selection methods (Tournament
 * Selection is a good choice) to fill the slack.
 * See ESEvolutionState for ideas on doing this with various
 * breeding pipeline examples.
