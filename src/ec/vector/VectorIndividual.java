/**
 * VectorIndividual is the abstract superclass of simple individual representations
 * which consist of vectors of values (booleans, integers, floating-point, etc.)
 *
 * <p>This class contains two methods, defaultCrossover and defaultMutate, which can
 * be overridden if all you need is a simple crossover and a simple mutate mechanism.
 * the VectorCrossoverPipeline and VectorMutationPipeline classes use these methods to do their
 * handiwork.  For more sophisticated crossover and mutation, you'll need to write
 * a custom breeding pipeline.
 *
 * <p>The <i>kind</i> of default crossover and mutation, and associated information,
 * is stored in the VectorIndividual's VectorSpecies object, which is obtained through
 * the <tt>species</tt> variable.  For example,
 * VectorIndividual assumes three common types of crossover as defined in VectorSpecies
 * which you should implement in your defaultCrossover method: one-point,
 * two-point, and any-point (otherwise known as "uniform") crossover.
 *
 * <p>VectorIndividual is typically used for fixed-length vector representations;
 * however, it can also be used with variable-length representations.  Two methods have
 * been provided in all subclasses of VectorIndividual to help you there: split and
 * join, which you can use to break up and reconnect VectorIndividuals in a variety
 * of ways.  Note that you may want to override the reset() method to create individuals
 * with different initial lengths.
 *
 * <p>VectorIndividuals must belong to the species VectorSpecies (or some subclass of it).
