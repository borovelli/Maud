/**
 * Problem is a prototype which defines the problem against which we will
 * evaluate individuals in a population.
 *
 * <p>Since Problems are Prototypes, you should expect a new Problem class to be
 * cloned and used, on a per-thread basis, for the evolution of each
 * chunk of individuals in a new population.  If you for some reason
 * need global Problem information, you will have to provide it
 * statically, or copy pointers over during the protoClone() process
 * (there is likely only one Problem prototype, depending on the
 * Evaluator class used).
 *
 * <p>Note that Problem does not implement a specific evaluation method.
 * Your particular Problem subclass will need to implement a some kind of
 * Problem Form (for example, SimpleProblemForm) appropriate to the kind of
 * evaluation being performed on the Problem.  These Problem Forms will provide
 * the evaluation methods necessary.
