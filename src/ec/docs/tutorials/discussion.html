			Post-Tutorial Discussion: Other Stuff ECJ Has Built In
			</h2>
			<p>ECJ can do quite a lot of stuff not covered in the tutorials, but until more tutorials are written :-) you'll have to dig around to find it.  Here are some such features.

<h3>Other Representations</h3>
<p><b>Sets and Multisets (Bags)</b> The <a href="../../classdocs/ec/rule/">ec.rule</a> package has facilities for making individuals which consist of one or more multisets (bags) each.  The notional idea is that individuals contain some fixed number of <i>rulesets</i>, each of which contains an arbitrary number of <i>rules</i>.  A rule is left undefined.  The notion of "rule" came from our original use for the package, which was to do Pitt-approach ruleset systems. This package comes with some simple breeding operators, though you'll probably want to make your own more specialized versions.  The package is also a good jumping-off point for building bags with constraints, such as sets or abitrarily-sized graph structures (neural nets, FSAs, etc.).  You'll need to build the constraints into the initialization and breeding operators.

<p><b>Strings</b> The representations in the <a href="../../classdocs/ec/vector/">ec.vector</a> package all have built-in methods (cut, join, etc.) for modifying arbitrary-length vectors (strings).  However the package doesn't presently come with breeding operators which call these methods to manipulate arbitrary-length vectors; you'll need to make breeding operators appropriate for your problem.

<p><b>Arbitrary Representations</b> It's fairly easy to make arbitrary representations with ECJ.  Just subclass <a href="../../classdocs/ec/Individual.html">Individual</a> and add in your own representation.  You may need to make your own <a hreff="../../classdocs/ec/BreedingPipeline.html">BreedingPipeline</a>s which know how to cross over or mutate your representation.

<h3>Genetic Programming Gizmos</h3>

<p><b>Breeding Operators</b>  In addition to standard subtree mutation and subtree crossover, ECJ comes with <a href="../../classdocs/ec/gp/breed/">eight breeding operators</a>, most of which :-) have been used in previous literature (the one exception, <a href="../../classdocs/ec/gp/breed/RehangPipeline.html">RehangPipeline</a>, is very interesting but perhaps not all that useful).  All operators but RehangPipeline work great with strong typing.

<p><b>Tree Generation Functions</b> Tired of GP's GROW, FULL, and RAMPED HALF-AND-HALF tree generators?  ECJ has 
<a href="../../classdocs/ec/gp/breed/">five more tree-generation functions</a>, most of which can guarantee tree sizes and all of which work nicely with strong typing.

<p><b>Forests, ADFs, ADMs, and ERCs</b> ECJ's GP individuals can have multiple trees.  ECJ's tree forests can support <a href="../../classdocs/ec/gp/ADF.html">Automatically Defined Functions (ADFs)</a> and <a href="../../classdocs/ec/gp/ADM.html">Automatically Defined Macros (ADMs)</a>.  At present ECJ does not have modification operators which permit Koza-style architecture-altering operations.  The system also has built-in support for a variety of <a href="../../classdocs/ec/gp/ERC.html">Ephemeral Random Constants (ERCs)</a>.  The <b>ec.app.regression</b> example shows one way of using ERCs.

<h3>Coevolution</h3>

<p>ECJ's populations are broken into multiple subpopulations.  Ordinarily you'd only use one subpopulation, but multiple subpopulations are particularly useful for coevolution.  The <a href="../../classdocs/ec/coevolve/">ec.coevolve</a> package has basic support for defining evaluation of an individual in the context of other individuals.  At present, however, ECJ only provides an evaluator which uses this support to perform one-subpopulation coevolution.  However, it's not too tough to write a multi-subpopulation evaluator; we just haven't needed to do so yet. :-)

<h3>Island Models</h3>

<p>Another use of multiple subpopulations is to perform <i>island models</i> inside an ECJ run, essentially treating each subpopulation as its own evolutionary run, with occasional migrations from subpopulation to subpopulation.  ECJ handles island models by plugging in <a href="../../classdocs/ec/Exchanger.html">Exchanger</a>s into the system.  For multiple islands within one run, one uses the <a href="../../classdocs/ec/exchange/InterPopulationExchange.html">ec.exchange.InterPopulationExchange</a> exchanger.  Alternatively, one can build an island model consisting of many different processes running on different networked computers.  ECJ supports such models with the <a href="../../classdocs/ec/exchange/IslandExchange.html">ec.exchange.IslandExchange</a> exchanger.  While <b>InterPopulationExchange</b> must be synchronous, <b>IslandExchange</b> can be either synchronous or asynchronous.

<p>Some caveats.  First, ECJ presently cannot support both <b>InterPopulationExchange</b> and <b>IslandExchange</b> simultaneously.  Second, island models are best done with generational evolutionary methods.  Third, an asynchronous <b>IslandExchange</b> cannot guarantee replicability (different computers run at different speeds).

<h3>Multiobjective Fitnesses</h3>

<p>ECJ only has hooks for multiobjective fitness; it does not have sophisticated selection methods (pareto optimization, etc.) yet.  ECJ's hooks come in the form of a custom Fitness subclass, <a href="../../classdocs/ec/multiobjective/MultiObjectiveFitness.html">MultiObjectiveFitness</a>, which can be plugged into basic evolutionary systems.

<p>ECJ's <a href="../../classdocs/ec/Fitness.html">Fitness</a>es are separate classes from individuals: thus you can plug in your own customized Fitness class if you don't like the ones provided.

<h3>Useful Breeding Operators and Selection Methods</h3>

<p>In addition to tournament selection, ECJ's <a href="../../classdocs/ec/select">ec.select</a> package supports Fitness Proportionate (Roulette) Selection, Koza-style Greedy Overselection, FirstSelection (returning the first individual in the population), BestSelection (picking uniformly from the best N individuals in the population), and a joint selection operator which picks from a variety of selection methods.

<p>ECJ's <a href="../../classdocs/ec/bree">ec.breed</a> has various classes which allow one to glue different breeding operators together in different ways.  For example, one can buffer results, force N individuals to be returned at a time, change the breeding operator after some N generations, and choose at random from N different breeding operators.

<h3>Steady State Evolution</h3>

<p>ECJ supports steady-state evolution in the <a href="../../classdocs/ec/steadystate/">ec.steadystate</a> package.  This package contains special breeders, evaluators, and evolution states.  Because steady state evolution isn't generational, there are certain things which are incompatable with it, or at least inappropriate for it.  For example, Island Models are not compatible with it.  And fitness proportionate selection and other statistics-based selection methods are inappropriate to use with steady state evolution because they need to be constantly updated every time a new individual is created.  Last, steady state evolution cannot run multithreaded.

<h3>Parsimony Pressure</h3>

<p>ECJ individuals have a <b>size()</b> method which they can overload to indicate their "size".  This can be used in parsimony pressure methods.  We have some built-in nonparametric parsimony pressure selection methods (lexicogaphic tournament, double tournament, ratio tournament) available in the <a href="../../classdocs/ec/parsimony">ec.parsimony</a> package.

<p>Recently Robert Hubley donated the <a href="../../classdocs/ec/multiobjective/spea2/">spea2</a> package consisting of classes which implement a simple version of the SPEA2 algorithm (a pareto-optimizing multiobjective algorithm for parsimony pressure).  Very cool!  I strongly suggest you poke around with it.

<h3>Utilities</h3>

The <a href="../../classdocs/ec/util/">util</a> package contains EC-independent utilities useful for all sorts of stuff.  You've seen a few of them: ParameterDatabase, Output, Code, and the MersenneTwisterFast random number generator.    You also used the checkpoint facility without accessing the Checkpoint class directly (and probably would never need to).  But you ought to know what else is available in this package to avoid reinventing the wheel!  Other utilities include:

<ul>
<li><b>RandomChoice</b>.  This class makes it easy to organize arrays of objects into random distributions and pick random objects under those distributions.
<li><b>QuickSort</b>.  Facilities for the Quick Sort algorithm.
<li><b>Version</b>.  The class that stores the current ECJ version number and other strings printed out at the beginning of a run.
<li><b>MersenneTwister</b>.  This class is a drop-in subclass replacement for <b>java.util.Random</b> which uses the Mersenne Twister algorithm rather than the Knuth Subtractive algorithm.  It differs from MersenneTwisterFast only in that its methods, like Random's, are synchronized so it can be used in multithreaded situations.  It's about twice as fast as Random, but half the speed of MersenneTwisterFast.
