Before you do anything else, please read the file "LICENSE",
located in this directory. It contains the software license
you are bound to if you wish to use this software -- note that
the license is not *quite* your normal open source license;
it requires you to make certain admissions about using ECJ in
your published research work.

Additionally, please see the following important files:

CHANGES			Change log.  Very important!
ABOUT.JDK13		How to deal with Sun's not-so-sharp
			decisions with regard to JDK 1.3
ABOUT.MacOS9		Using ECJ under MacOS 9
ABOUT.MacOSX		Comments about ECJ under MacOS X (ECJ was
			developed under Solaris, but MacOS X has
			been my system of choice as of ECJ 4)
index.html		A copy of the main web page at
			http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/plus/ec/ecj/
docs/index.html		ECJ documentation
Makefile		Useful if you're running under UNIX
